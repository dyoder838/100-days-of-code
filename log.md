### Day 2: January 2 2021
##### 

**Today's Progress**: I found an internship project for shopify. creating a movie award app using IMDB. I started learning the components for Polaris - shopifys front end. I created a kanban board in my github repo. and will begin wire framing tomorrow. 

**Thoughts:** there are so many components to learn, I need to figure out how to configure them to my needs - make them work with the IMDB API. I want to use Polaris because thats what I assume we would be using as interns - or at least adding to it.

### Day 3: January 5 2021
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Continued to work on polaris and understanding its components. 

**Thoughts:** I finally figured out how to make the components in polaris to work. I am so used to Material UI - and approaching polaris from the same perspective was not helpful.
