### Day 0: December 31 2020
##### 

**Today's Progress**: I forked this repo and began searching fro projects. 

**Thoughts:** I'm looking for job opportunities, shopify has an internship program that requires a coding challenge. im going to start there

### Day 2: January 2 2021
##### 

**Today's Progress**: I found an internship project for shopify. creating a movie award app using IMDB. I started learning the components for Polaris - shopifys front end. I created a kanban board in my github repo. and will begin wire framing tomorrow. 

**Thoughts:** there are so many components to learn, I need to figure out how to configure them to my needs - make them work with the IMDB API. I want to use Polaris because thats what I assume we would be using as interns - or at least adding to it.

### Day 3: January 5 2021
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Continued to work on polaris and understanding its components. 

**Thoughts:** I finally figured out how to make the components in polaris to work. I am so used to Material UI - and approaching polaris from the same perspective was not helpful.

### Day 4: January 9 2021
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on cleaning up old projects, my password generator needs some work with the randomization, it repeats the same pattern of upper, lower, digit, symbol over and over again - I'm working on converting the loop that causes this into a randomized array that can then be mapped over. 

**Thoughts:** I thought I had this down, but the "Inception" in randomizing a random randomizer gets confusing. Ill hit it again tomorrow with a clear mind and a fresh cup of coffee.
