# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 31 2020
##### 

**Today's Progress**: I forked this repo and began searching fro projects. 

**Thoughts:** I'm looking for job opportunities, shopify has an internship program that requires a coding challenge. im going to start there

### Day 2: January 2 2021
##### 

**Today's Progress**: I found an internship project for shopify. creating a movie award app using IMDB. I started learning the components for Polaris - shopifys front end. I created a kanban board in my github repo. and will begin wire framing tomorrow. 

**Thoughts:** there are so many components to learn, I need to figure out how to configure them to my needs - make them work with the IMDB API. I want to use Polaris because thats what I assume we would be using as interns - or at least adding to it.

### Day 3: January 5 2021
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Continued to work on polaris and understanding its components. 

**Thoughts:** I finally figured out how to make the components in polaris to work. I am so used to Material UI - and approaching polaris from the same perspective was not helpful.

### Day 4: January 9 2021
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on cleaning up old projects, my password generator needs some work with the randomization, it repeats the same pattern of upper, lower, digit, symbol over and over again - I'm working on converting the loop that causes this into a randomized array that can then be mapped over. 

**Thoughts:** I thought I had this down, but the "Inception" in randomizing a random randomizer gets confusing. Ill hit it again tomorrow with a clear mind and a fresh cup of coffee.

### Day 5: January 16 2021
##### 

**Today's Progress**: finally figured out my password generation problem - I was over thinking it. just needed to push a returned value from a function to an array - don't know why I didn't just array.push() within a loop. but now I did

**Thoughts:** so yes day 5 is actually day 16... life happens, but im not giving up - getting this seemingly small thing done felt really good. and I learned some misconceptions I had, as well as terminology that was just flat wrong - rewrote most of my comments.

### Day 6: January 18 2021
##### 

**Today's Progress**: continued working on a template website using react - learning about using swipe navigation in React using react-swipeable-views and react-swipeable-routes. lots of reading... todays work in "RoadSign" Component.

**Thoughts:** this seems overly complex....

### Day 7: January 19 2021
##### 

**Today's Progress**: 90% reading 10% coding. I'm still walking through my components for a complete Phase 1 (see repo). I completely forgot that I can use .Josn files to simulate a backend. I finished up half way through my main page.  

**Thoughts:** I keep having to stop myself from coding react like its HTML.. adding content manually instead of creating reuseable components and passing them props.
